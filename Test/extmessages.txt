&mymessage=SEND YOUR GREETINGS HERE&


Note 1: -
Just change the text you see in capitals on top between "=" and "&"
and what ever you type in between them will appear in your clock.
Remember to send both files together  (the clock and the text file)
to anyone you want and they will see your greetings or message.

Note 2: -
To see the text displayed in the clock dial both files have to be 
together in the same directory.


Note 3:-
If you are using this clock on your website then keep both the files together
in the same directory and keep a file in the same directory as your webpage
on which you have embedded the flash clock.

Embed code for Flash clock is given below (remember to change the width and height as required)
